Paperless Office System : 
This project aims to transition a traditional paper-based regional office to a paperless office by creating a web application that streamlines project management processes for government employees and construction organizations. The solution reduces the need for physical paperwork, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and information security. The web application will provide dashboards for users to manage all their work digitally, speeding up workflows, saving time, and reducing transportation costs for construction organizations.

Key Features:
* Dashboard: Separate dashboards for government employees and construction organizations to manage all project-related information effectively.
* Efficiency & Speed: Faster processing times by eliminating paper-based workflows.
* Environmental Benefits: Reduces the use of natural resources by minimizing paper consumption.

Technologies Used:
* Python: Leveraging Pythonâ€™s simplicity and extensive libraries to reduce development time.
* Django: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development, offering inbuilt security against XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
* SQLite: Lightweight, serverless SQL database for easy data management.
